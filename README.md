# PurgeMyBags

A World of Warcraft addon that helps you clean up your bags by automatically deleting unwanted items while protecting items you want to keep.

## How it Works

PurgeMyBags provides three ways to protect (whitelist) items from being deleted:

1. **By Expansion**
   - Keep all items from specific expansions (e.g., all Dragonflight items)
   - Toggle entire expansions on/off with a single click

2. **By Item Type**
   - Protect entire categories of items (e.g., all Consumables)
   - Supported types include:
     - Armor
     - Weapons
     - Consumables
     - Containers
     - Reagents
     - Recipes
     - Gems
     - Glyphs
     - Quest Items
     - Trade Goods
     - Miscellaneous

3. **Individual Items**
   - Use the visual inventory browser to manage specific items
   - Click items to toggle their protection status
   - Items can be whitelisted regardless of their type or expansion

## Features

- **Visual Inventory Browser**
  - See all your items at a glance
  - Items marked for deletion appear faded with a red tint
  - Protected items appear at full brightness
  - Easy click-to-toggle protection

- **Safe Deletion Process**

  - Confirmation window shows exactly what will be deleted
  - Double confirmation system prevents accidents
  - Clear visual feedback on what's protected

2. Type `/pmb config` to open the settings panel
3. Use the inventory browser to visually manage your items
